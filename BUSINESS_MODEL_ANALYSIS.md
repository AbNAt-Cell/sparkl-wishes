- ✅ Revenue scales with usage
- ✅ Aligns incentives (we succeed when users succeed)
- ✅ Minimal friction

---

## 💰 REVENUE STREAMS (Recommended Priority)

### 1. **TRANSACTION FEES** (Primary Revenue - 80%)
**Current Implementation**: ✅ Already in place

**Model**: Take a small percentage of each successful payment

**Recommended Structure:**
```
Standard Users (Free):
- 4.5% platform fee on all payments
- Paystack fee: ~1.5%
- Net to platform: ~3% after payment processing

Example:
- Guest pays ₦10,000 for gift
- Platform fee: ₦450
- Paystack: ₦150
- User receives: ₦9,400
- Platform earns: ₦300
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ No upfront cost for users
- ✅ Only pay when receiving money
- ✅ Feels fair (small percentage)
- ✅ Scales with transaction volume
- ✅ Hidden from gift givers (included in price)

**Projected Revenue:**
- 1,000 users × 5 gifts/user × ₦15,000/gift × 3% = **₦2.25M/month**
- At scale (10,000 users): **₦22.5M/month**
